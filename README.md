# Power BI Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases my Power BI analytics projects developed during structured training and hands-on practice.
The dashboards focus on solving real-world business problems across sales, HR, operations, and executive reporting.

Each project demonstrates skills in data preparation, data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive visualization,
and business storytelling.
